Starting homework 2. 

1. A sentence with correct syntax but incorrect characters would be, "Th!s sent3nce is c0rrec+"
A sentence with incorrect syntax but correct characters would be, "Sentence is correct this"
Natural languages has some words that may have multiple different meanings, as well as too many filler gramatical words like "too, to, there, them" that would be hard to follow in code. Some more complex parts of natural language, like figurative language, would make it near impossible to run some function when its meaning may not be exactly as written.
